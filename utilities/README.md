### `backgroundJob()`

```typescript
export function backgroundJob(
  {
    interval,
    intervalVariance = 0.1,
  }: {
    interval: number;
    intervalVariance?: number;
  },
  job: () => void | Promise<void>,
): {
  run: () => void;
  stop: () => void;
};
```

Start a background job that runs every `interval`.

This is different from `setInterval()` in the following ways:

1. The interval counts **between** jobs, so slow background jobs don‚Äôt get called concurrently:

   ```
   setInterval()
   | SLOW BACKGROUND JOB |
   | INTERVAL | SLOW BACKGROUND JOB |
              | INTERVAL | ...

   backgroundJob()
   | SLOW BACKGROUND JOB | INTERVAL | SLOW BACKGROUND JOB | INTERVAL | ...
   ```

2. We introduce a random `intervalVariance` to avoid many background jobs from starting at the same time and overloading the machine.

3. You may use `backgroundJob.run()` to force the background job to run right away. If the background job is already running, calling `backgroundJob.run()` schedules it to run again as soon as possible (with a wait interval of 0).

4. You may use `backgroundJob.stop()` to stop the background job. If the background job is running, it will finish but it will not be scheduled to run again. This is similar to how an HTTP server may terminate gracefully by stopping accepting new requests but finishing responding to existing requests. After a job has been stopped, you may not `backgroundJob.run()` it again (calling `backgroundJob.run()` has no effect).

5. In Node.js the background job is stopped on [`"gracefulTermination"`](https://github.com/radically-straightforward/radically-straightforward/tree/main/node#graceful-termination).

**Example**

```javascript
import * as utilities from "@radically-straightforward/utilities";

const backgroundJob = utilities.backgroundJob(
  { interval: 3 * 1000 },
  async () => {
    console.log("backgroundJob(): Running background job...");
    await utilities.sleep(3 * 1000);
    console.log("backgroundJob(): ...finished running background job.");
  },
);
process.on("SIGTSTP", () => {
  backgroundJob.run();
});
console.log(
  "backgroundJob(): Press ‚åÉZ to force background job to run and ‚åÉC to continue...",
);
```

### `sleep()`

```typescript
export function sleep(duration: number): Promise<void>;
```

A promisified version of `setTimeout()`. Bare-bones: It doesn‚Äôt even offer a way to `clearTimeout()`. Useful in JavaScript that may run in the browser‚Äîif you‚Äôre only targeting Node.js then you‚Äôre better served by [`timersPromises.setTimeout()`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v21.x/docs/api/timers.html#timerspromisessettimeoutdelay-value-options).

### `randomString()`

```typescript
export function randomString(): string;
```

A fast random string generator. The generated strings vary in length, but are generally around 10 characters. The generated strings include the characters `[a-z0-9]`. The generated strings are **not** cryptographically secure‚Äîif you need that, then use [`crypto-random-string`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-random-string).

### `log()`

```typescript
export function log(...messageParts: string[]): void;
```

Tab-separated logging.

### `Interned`

```typescript
export type Interned<Type> = Readonly<
  Type & {
    [internSymbol]: true;
  }
>;
```

Utility type for `intern()`.

### `InternInnerValue`

```typescript
export type InternInnerValue =
  | string
  | number
  | bigint
  | boolean
  | symbol
  | undefined
  | null
  | Interned<unknown>;
```

Utility type for `intern()`.

### `intern()`

```typescript
export function intern<
  Type extends
    | Array<InternInnerValue>
    | {
        [key: string | symbol]: InternInnerValue;
      },
>(value: Type): Interned<Type>;
```

[Interning](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interning_(computer_science)>) a value makes it unique across the program, which is useful for checking equality with `===` (reference equality), using it as a key in a `Map`, adding it to a `Set`, and so forth:

```typescript
import { intern as $ } from "@radically-straightforward/utilities";

[1] === [1]; // => false
$([1]) === $([1]); // => true

{
  const map = new Map<number[], number>();
  map.set([1], 1);
  map.set([1], 2);
  map.size; // => 2
  map.get([1]); // => undefined
}

{
  const map = new Map<utilities.Intern<number[]>, number>();
  map.set($([1]), 1);
  map.set($([1]), 2);
  map.size; // => 1
  map.get($([1])); // => 2
}

{
  const set = new Set<number[]>();
  set.add([1]);
  set.add([1]);
  set.size; // => 2
  set.has([1]); // => false
}

{
  const set = new Set<utilities.Intern<number[]>>();
  set.add($([1]));
  set.add($([1]));
  set.size; // => 1
  set.has($([1])); // => true
}
```

> **Note:** We recommend that you alias `intern as $` when importing it to make your code less noisy.

> **Node:** Inner values must be either primitives or interned values themselves, for example, `$([1, $({})])` is valid, but `$([1, {}])` is not.

> **Node:** Currently only arrays (tuples) and objects (records) may be interned. In the future we may support more types, for example, `Map`, `Set`, regular expressions, and so forth.

> **Note:** You must not mutate an interned value. Interned values are [frozen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) to prevent mutation.

> **Note:** Interned objects do not preserve the order of the attributes: `$({ a: 1, b: 2 }) === $({ b: 2, a: 1 })`.

> **Note:** The pool of interned values is available as `intern._pool`. The interned values are kept with `WeakRef`s to allow them to be garbage collected when they aren‚Äôt referenced anywhere else anymore. There‚Äôs a `FinalizationRegistry` at `intern._finalizationRegistry` that cleans up interned values that have been garbage collected.

> **Note:** `+0` and `-0` are not necessarily preserved. ie `Object.is($([+0])[0], $([-0])[0])` returns `true`

**Related Work**

**[JavaScript Records & Tuples Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple)**

A proposal to include immutable objects (Records) and immutable arrays (Tuples) in JavaScript. This subsumes most of the need for `intern()`.

It includes a [polyfill](https://github.com/bloomberg/record-tuple-polyfill) which works very similarly to `intern()` but requires different functions for different data types.

**[`collections-deep-equal`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/collections-deep-equal)**

A previous solution to this problem which took a different approach: Instead of interning the values and allowing you to use JavaScript‚Äôs `Map`s and `Set`s, `collections-deep-equal` extends `Map`s and `Set`s with a different notion of equality.

`collections-deep-equal` doesn‚Äôt address the issue of comparing values with `===` (reference equality).

`collections-deep-equal` does more work on every manipulation of the data structure, for example, when looking up a key in a `Map`, so it may be slower.

`collections-deep-equal` has different intern pools for each `Map` and `Set` instead of `intern()`‚Äôs single global intern pool, which may be advantageous because smaller pools may be faster to traverse.

**[Immutable.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutable), [`collections`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/collections), [`mori`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mori), [TypeScript Collections](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-collections), [`prelude-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prelude-ts), [`collectable`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/collectable), and so forth**

Similar to `collections-deep-equal`, these libraries implement their own data structures instead of relying on JavaScript‚Äôs `Map`s and `Set`s. Some of them go a step further and add their own notions of objects and arrays, which requires you to convert your values back and forth, may not show up nicely in the JavaScript inspector, may be less ergonomic to use with TypeScript, and so forth.

**[`immer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immer) and [`icepick`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/icepick)**

Introduce a new way to create values based on existing values.

**[`seamless-immutable`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seamless-immutable)**

Modifies existing values more profoundly than freezing.

**[`es6-array-map`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-array-map), [`valuecollection`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/valuecollection), [`@strong-roots-capital/map-objects`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@strong-roots-capital/map-objects), and so forth**

Similar to `collections-deep-equal` but either incomplete, or lacking type definitions, and so forth.
